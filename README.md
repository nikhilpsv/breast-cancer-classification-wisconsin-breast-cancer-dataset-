Detection Of Breast Cancer Using Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithm



In the first step of the process we have gathered the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset from UCI repository the collected data is explored using exploratory data analysis by plotting various types of graphs. The data collected is the pre-processed using standardization method. Features are selected using Univariate feature selection technique which uses ANOVA test then several classification algorithms are applied separately to register the accuracy. At the last,we have utilized ensemble techniques to get better accuracy.
